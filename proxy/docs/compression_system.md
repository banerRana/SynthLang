## Key Features

### Semantic Compression

SynthLang's primary compression method preserves meaning while reducing token count:

- **Symbolic Notation**: Converts natural language into compact symbolic representations
- **Semantic Preservation**: Maintains the full meaning of prompts despite size reduction
- **Context Optimization**: Intelligently restructures prompts to minimize redundancy
- **Domain-Specific Patterns**: Recognizes and compresses domain-specific language patterns

### GZIP Integration

For maximum efficiency, SynthLang supports additional gzip compression:

- **Binary Compression**: Applied to already semantically compressed prompts for extra reduction
- **Base64 Encoding**: Allows safe transmission of binary compressed data as text
- **Automatic Detection**: Seamless decompression of gzipped content
- **Smart Application**: Automatically determines when gzip would be beneficial

### Pattern Discovery

The system continuously improves by learning from the data it processes:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common patterns in prompts
- **Compression Rule Generation**: Creates new compression rules based on observed patterns
- **Progressive Improvement**: Compression efficiency increases over time
- **Domain Adaptation**: Automatically optimizes for specific use cases

## How It Works

### Compression Process

1. **Input Analysis**: The prompt is analyzed to identify patterns and structure
2. **Symbolic Conversion**: Natural language elements are converted to symbolic notation
3. **Structural Optimization**: The structure is reorganized for maximum efficiency
4. **Token Minimization**: Redundant or implied information is removed
5. **Optional GZIP**: If enabled, the result is further compressed with gzip

### Symbolic Notation

SynthLang uses a specialized symbolic language inspired by mathematical notation:

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `↹` | Context separation | `↹ domain•constraints•requirements` |
| `•` | Item delimiter | `context•parameters` |
| `⊕` | Process or transformation | `⊕ analyze => result` |
| `Σ` | Output or summary | `Σ solution + validation` |
| `⊂` | Subset or inclusion | `⊂ requirements•assumptions` |
| `→` | Flow or sequence | `input → processing → output` |
| `≡` | Definition or equivalence | `problem ≡ challenge•constraints` |
| `∴` | Therefore or conclusion | `∴ optimize for performance` |
| `∀` | For all or universal | `∀ inputs•validate` |
| `∃` | There exists or existential | `∃ solution•optimal` |

### Mathematical Frameworks

SynthLang compression leverages various mathematical frameworks:

- **Set Theory**: For component combination and analysis
- **Category Theory**: For structure-preserving transformations
- **Topology**: For continuous transformations and boundaries
- **Abstract Algebra**: For operation composition and invariants

### Decompression Process

1. **GZIP Decompression**: If gzipped, the content is first decompressed
2. **Symbolic Expansion**: Symbolic notation is expanded back to natural language
3. **Context Restoration**: Implied context is restored
4. **Structure Reformation**: The original structure is reconstructed

## Configuration

The compression system can be configured through environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `USE_SYNTHLANG` | Enable/disable SynthLang compression | `1` (enabled) | `USE_SYNTHLANG=1` |
| `DEFAULT_USE_GZIP` | Default for gzip compression | `0` (disabled) | `DEFAULT_USE_GZIP=1` |
| `GZIP_SIZE_THRESHOLD` | Minimum size (chars) for auto-gzip | `5000` | `GZIP_SIZE_THRESHOLD=2000` |
| `COMPRESSION_LEVEL` | Compression aggressiveness (1-9) | `5` | `COMPRESSION_LEVEL=7` |
| `DOMAIN_SPECIFIC_COMPRESSION` | Enable domain-specific compression | `1` (enabled) | `DOMAIN_SPECIFIC_COMPRESSION=1` |
| `COMPRESSION_PATTERNS_PATH` | Path to custom patterns file | - | `COMPRESSION_PATTERNS_PATH=patterns.toml` |
