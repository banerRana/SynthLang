## Core Features

### Prompt Compression

SynthLang Proxy significantly reduces token usage and costs through its advanced prompt compression techniques.

#### Overview of SynthLang Compression

SynthLang compression is a proprietary semantic compression algorithm that preserves the meaning of prompts while drastically reducing the token count. It uses symbolic representation, semantic preservation, context optimization, and domain-specific patterns to achieve high compression ratios.

#### How to Enable and Use Compression

Prompt compression is enabled by default in SynthLang Proxy. You can control it using the `USE_SYNTHLANG` environment variable in your `.env` file. Set `USE_SYNTHLANG=1` to enable or `USE_SYNTHLANG=0` to disable.

When enabled, SynthLang Proxy automatically compresses incoming prompts before sending them to the LLM provider and decompresses responses before returning them to the client. This process is transparent to your application.

#### Compression Methods and Options

SynthLang Proxy offers multiple compression methods:

- **SynthLang Compression**: Semantic compression using symbolic notation.
- **SynthLang + Gzip**: Combines SynthLang compression with gzip for even higher compression ratios. Enable gzip compression by setting `use_gzip: true` in your request payload.

#### Performance Benefits and Cost Savings

SynthLang compression offers significant performance benefits:

- **Reduced Token Usage**: Up to 75% token reduction, leading to substantial cost savings.
- **Improved Latency**: Smaller prompts result in faster processing times and lower latency.
- **Increased Throughput**: Reduced token processing overhead allows for higher request throughput.

See the [Benchmarking Documentation](benchmarking.md) for detailed performance metrics and cost savings analysis.

### Semantic Caching

Semantic caching in SynthLang Proxy drastically improves response times and reduces costs by storing and reusing responses to semantically similar queries.

#### Overview of Semantic Caching

SynthLang Proxy's semantic cache stores LLM responses based on the semantic meaning of the requests, not just exact text matches. This allows the proxy to return cached responses for queries that are similar but not identical to previous requests.

#### How Caching Works in SynthLang Proxy

1.  **Request Analysis**: When a request is received, SynthLang Proxy analyzes its semantic meaning.
2.  **Cache Lookup**: The proxy searches the semantic cache for semantically similar previous requests.
3.  **Cache Hit**: If a similar request is found (cache hit), the cached response is returned immediately, bypassing the LLM call.
4.  **Cache Miss**: If no similar request is found (cache miss), the request is forwarded to the LLM, and the response is stored in the cache for future use.

#### Configuration Options for Caching

Semantic caching can be configured using environment variables in your `.env` file:

- `ENABLE_CACHE`: Enable or disable semantic caching (default: `1` for enabled, `0` for disabled).
- `CACHE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`:  Adjust the similarity threshold (0.0-1.0) for cache hits. A higher threshold (e.g., 0.95) requires very high similarity, while a lower threshold (e.g., 0.85) allows for more flexible matching.
- `CACHE_MAX_ITEMS`: Set the maximum number of items to store in the cache.

#### Cache Invalidation and Management

SynthLang Proxy automatically manages the cache, evicting older or less frequently used items when the cache reaches its maximum capacity. You can also manually clear the cache using the CLI command:

```bash
synthlang proxy clear-cache
```

#### Monitoring Cache Performance

To monitor the performance of the semantic cache, you can use the CLI command:

```bash
synthlang proxy cache-stats
```

This command provides statistics about cache hits, misses, and cache size, helping you optimize your caching configuration.

### Agent Framework

SynthLang Proxy transforms static LLM applications into dynamic, agentic systems with its built-in agent framework.

#### Introduction to Agentic Capabilities

The agent framework allows you to extend your LLM applications with agentic capabilities, enabling them to perform actions, interact with tools, and make decisions based on user requests. SynthLang Proxy supports tools, function calling, and multi-step workflows, all triggered dynamically from user prompts.

#### Built-in Tools and Agents

SynthLang Proxy includes several built-in tools and agents:

- **Web Search**: Uses OpenAI's search capability to perform web searches.
- **File Search**: Searches through files using semantic similarity.
- **Weather**: Gets weather information for a location.
- **Calculator**: Performs calculations and conversions.
- **Data Analysis Pipeline**: Orchestrates a complete data analysis workflow (premium feature).
- **Research Assistant**: Conducts comprehensive research across multiple sources (premium feature).
- **Content Creation Agent**: Generates complex content with multiple components (premium feature).

You can list available tools using the CLI command:

```bash
synthlang proxy tools
```

#### How to Use Tools in Prompts

Tools can be invoked in prompts using special directives, hashtags, or natural language patterns.

- **Hashtag Directives**: Use hashtags like `#tool_summarize` or `#tool_weather` to explicitly trigger tools. For example:

  ```
  #tool_weather London
  ```

- **Natural Language Patterns**: The Keyword Detection System automatically identifies patterns in user messages and invokes relevant tools. For example, asking "What's the weather in New York?" will trigger the `weather` tool.

- **Function Calling**: Use `#function` directives to call specific functions with parameters. For example:

  ```
  #function calculate_roi(investment=1000, return=1200)
  ```

#### Extending with Custom Tools

You can easily extend SynthLang Proxy with custom tools by implementing tool functions and registering them with the agent registry. See the [Development Documentation](development.md) for details on creating and registering custom tools.

#### Agentic Workflows and Examples

Agentic workflows enable complex, multi-step processes to be orchestrated from user prompts. For example, the `Data Analysis Pipeline` agent can be triggered by a user request like:

```
Analyze the sales data from Q1 2025 and generate a forecast
```

This will initiate a multi-step workflow involving data loading, cleaning, analysis, and reporting, all handled by the `data_analysis_agent` tool.

### Keyword Detection System

The Keyword Detection System in SynthLang Proxy intelligently identifies patterns in user messages and automatically activates appropriate tools.

#### Overview of Keyword Detection

The Keyword Detection System acts as middleware, analyzing user messages against a registry of keyword patterns. When a pattern is matched, the system extracts parameters and invokes the corresponding tool, enabling context-aware interactions without explicit tool commands.

#### How to Configure Keyword Patterns

Keyword patterns are configured in TOML files or programmatically. Each pattern definition includes:

- **Name**: Unique identifier for the pattern.
- **Pattern**: Regular expression to match user messages. Use named capture groups to extract parameters.
- **Tool**: Name of the tool to invoke.
- **Description**: Human-readable description.
- **Required Role**: (Optional) Role required to use the pattern.
- **Priority**: Pattern priority (higher values checked first).
- **Enabled**: Whether the pattern is active.

Example TOML configuration:

```toml
[patterns.weather_query]
name = "weather_query"
pattern = "(?:what's|what is|how's|how is)\\s+(?:the)?\\s*(?:weather|temperature)\\s+(?:like)?\\s*(?:in|at|near)?\\s+(?P<location>[\\w\\s]+)"
tool = "weather"
description = "Detects weather queries"
priority = 100
enabled = true
```

You can manage keyword patterns using the CLI `keywords.py` tool. See the [CLI Documentation](cli.md) for details.

#### Role-Based Access Control for Keywords

Keyword patterns can be restricted to specific user roles. The `required_role` parameter in the pattern configuration allows you to specify the role needed to trigger the pattern. This ensures that sensitive tools are only accessible to authorized users.

#### Using Keywords for Tool Invocation

When a user message matches a keyword pattern and the user has the required role (if specified), the Keyword Detection System automatically invokes the associated tool. Parameters extracted from the message using named capture groups in the regex pattern are passed to the tool function.

#### Guard Rail Implementation with Keywords

The Keyword Detection System can be used to implement guard rails for content moderation, PII detection, jailbreak prevention, and safety measures. By defining patterns for harmful content, toxic language, or self-harm indicators, you can automatically trigger tools that enforce policies, filter content, or provide crisis support.

Example guard rail pattern:

```toml
[patterns.harmful_content]
name = "harmful_content_detector"
pattern = "(?i)(?:how to|tutorial|guide|instructions for)\\s+(?:hack|steal|break into|illegally access)\\s+(?P<target>.+)"
tool = "content_moderator"
description = "Detects requests for harmful content"
priority = 200
required_role = "basic"
enabled = true
```

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

SynthLang Proxy implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to provide flexible and secure user permission management.

#### Introduction to RBAC

RBAC enables fine-grained control over user access to features, tools, and resources within SynthLang Proxy. It uses roles, which are collections of permissions assigned to users. The system includes a role hierarchy where higher-level roles inherit permissions from lower-level roles.

Default roles:

- **basic**: Default role for all users.
- **premium**: Enhanced access with additional features.
- **admin**: Administrative access for system management.

Role Hierarchy:

```
admin → premium → basic
```

#### Role Hierarchy and Permissions

The role hierarchy defines inheritance:

- `admin` users inherit `premium` and `basic` permissions.
- `premium` users inherit `basic` permissions.
- `basic` role is the foundation for all users.

Permissions are implicitly defined by role assignment. For example, premium role might grant access to advanced tools, while admin role grants access to system configuration endpoints.

#### Configuration of Roles and Users

RBAC is configured using environment variables:

- `ADMIN_USERS`: Comma-separated list of user IDs with admin role.
- `PREMIUM_USERS`: Comma-separated list of premium user IDs.
- `DEFAULT_ROLE`: Default role for new users (default: "basic").

Example:

```
ADMIN_USERS=user1,user2
PREMIUM_USERS=user3,user4,user5
DEFAULT_ROLE=basic
```

Roles are also defined programmatically in the system:

```python
ROLE_HIERARCHY = {
    "admin": ["premium"],
    "premium": ["basic"],
    "basic": []
}

DEFAULT_ROLES = ["basic"]
```

#### Integrating RBAC with Tools and Keywords

RBAC is integrated with:

- **Tool Registry**: Restrict tool access using the `@require_role` decorator.
- **Keyword Detection System**: Restrict pattern matching using the `required_role` parameter in keyword definitions.
- **API Endpoints**: Protect API endpoints by checking user roles before granting access.

#### Security Considerations for RBAC

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign roles with minimal necessary permissions.
- **Admin Role Restriction**: Limit admin roles to trusted users.
- **Regular Audits**: Audit role assignments periodically.
- **Role Verification**: Always verify roles server-side before granting access.
- **Secure Role Storage**: For production, consider database-backed role storage.
