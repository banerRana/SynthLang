## Best Practices

This section provides tips and best practices for optimal performance, security, and prompt engineering with SynthLang Proxy.

### Tips for Optimal Performance and Security

- **Enable Semantic Caching**: Semantic caching significantly reduces latency and costs. Ensure `ENABLE_CACHE=1` and tune `CACHE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` for your use case.
- **Use Prompt Compression**: SynthLang compression reduces token usage and improves throughput. Enable `USE_SYNTHLANG=1` for cost savings. Consider enabling gzip compression (`use_gzip: true` in requests) for very large prompts.
- **Configure Rate Limiting**: Set appropriate rate limits (`DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT_QPM`, `PREMIUM_RATE_LIMIT`) to protect your proxy server from abuse.
- **Implement RBAC**: Use Role-Based Access Control to secure access to sensitive tools and features. Define roles and assign users appropriately.
- **Monitor Logs**: Regularly monitor logs (`proxy.log`) for errors, warnings, and performance insights. Set `LOG_LEVEL` to `INFO` or `DEBUG` for detailed logging.
- **Benchmark Regularly**: Use the benchmarking framework to measure performance and optimize configurations. Run benchmarks after configuration changes or updates.
- **Secure API Keys**: Protect your OpenAI API key and SynthLang Proxy API key. Do not expose keys in client-side code or public repositories. Use environment variables to manage API keys securely.
- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Ensure `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set to protect sensitive data at rest.
- **Regularly Update**: Keep SynthLang Proxy and its dependencies updated to the latest versions for security patches and performance improvements.

### Best Practices for Prompt Engineering with SynthLang Proxy

- **Use SynthLang Symbolic Notation**: Leverage SynthLang's symbolic notation for concise and efficient prompts. Translate natural language prompts to SynthLang format using the CLI `translate` command.
- **Optimize Prompts with DSPy**: Use SynthLang's DSPy integration to optimize prompts for clarity, specificity, and performance. Experiment with prompt optimization techniques using the `/v1/synthlang/optimize` endpoint.
- **Evolve Prompts for Continuous Improvement**: Utilize prompt evolution techniques to automatically improve prompt performance over time. Use the `/v1/synthlang/evolve` endpoint to evolve prompts using genetic algorithms.
- **Manage Prompts Effectively**: Use SynthLang's prompt management features to save, load, list, and compare prompts. Organize prompts with metadata and version history.
- **Design Effective Keyword Patterns**: Create well-defined keyword patterns for accurate tool invocation and guard rail implementation. Use named capture groups for parameter extraction and prioritize patterns appropriately.
- **Test and Validate Prompts**: Thoroughly test and validate prompts for different scenarios and user inputs. Use the benchmarking framework to measure prompt performance and identify areas for improvement.
- **Iterate and Refine**: Prompt engineering is an iterative process. Continuously refine and improve prompts based on performance metrics, user feedback, and benchmark results.
