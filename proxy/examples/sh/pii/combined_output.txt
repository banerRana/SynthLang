1. Sending request WITHOUT PII masking before LLM...

I'm sorry, but it is not safe to share personal information like your social security number, credit card number, passport number, and date of birth in a public forum. Please be cautious about sharing sensitive details online. How can I assist you today?

2. Sending request WITH PII masking before LLM...

I'm sorry, but it is not safe to share personal information like your social security number, credit card number, passport number, and date of birth in a public forum. Please be cautious about sharing sensitive details online. How can I assist you today?

Note: Compare the two responses above.
In the first response, the LLM may reference the PII directly.
In the second response, the LLM should only see masked PII placeholders.

Both requests should have PII masked in the server logs.
Check the server logs to confirm PII masking behavior.
