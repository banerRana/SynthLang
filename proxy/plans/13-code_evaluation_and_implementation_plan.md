# SynthLang Proxy Code Evaluation and Implementation Plan

## Current State Evaluation

### Overview

The SynthLang Proxy is a high-performance middleware solution designed to optimize interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). It currently implements several key features including API compatibility with OpenAI, SynthLang prompt compression, semantic caching, rate limiting, authentication, database persistence, and agent tools.

### Component-by-Component Analysis

- Uses semantic caching for similar queries
- Persists interactions to the database
- Includes proper error handling and logging

**Issues:**
- The `on_event` startup handler is deprecated according to FastAPI warnings

- Supports both compression and decompression

**Issues:**
- Limited error handling for SynthLang failures

- No metrics for compression efficiency

#### 9. Agent Tools (`agents/tools/`)

**Current State:**
- Implements a tool registry for agent capabilities
- Includes web search tool using OpenAI's search capability
- Implements file search tool with vector embeddings
- Uses FAISS for similarity search

**Issues:**
- Limited tool selection
- No tool versioning or compatibility checks
- In-memory vector stores (not persistent)
- Limited error handling for tool failures

### Test Coverage

The test suite appears comprehensive with 71 passing tests covering all major components. However, there are some warnings about deprecated Pydantic validators and FastAPI event handlers.
