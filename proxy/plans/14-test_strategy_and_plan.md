# SynthLang Proxy Test Strategy and Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the SynthLang Proxy implementation plan. It details the testing approach for each phase of development, test types, test environments, and success criteria.

## Testing Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features
2. **Continuous Testing**: Run tests automatically on every code change
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all components and their interactions
4. **Realistic Scenarios**: Test with real-world usage patterns
5. **Security First**: Prioritize security testing throughout development

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests verify the functionality of individual components in isolation.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Fast execution (milliseconds per test)
- No external dependencies (use mocks/stubs)
- High code coverage (aim for >90%)
- Test edge cases and error handling

**Tools:**
- pytest for test execution
- pytest-asyncio for async tests
- unittest.mock for mocking dependencies

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Test component interactions
- May use external dependencies or containerized versions
- Focus on API contracts and data flow
- Test realistic scenarios

**Tools:**
- pytest for test execution
- Docker for containerized dependencies
- TestClient from FastAPI for API testing

### 3. Performance Tests

Performance tests measure system behavior under various load conditions.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Measure response times, throughput, and resource usage
- Test with different concurrency levels
- Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Establish performance baselines

**Tools:**
- locust for load testing
- pytest-benchmark for micro-benchmarks
- Prometheus for metrics collection

### 4. Security Tests

Security tests verify that the system is protected against common vulnerabilities.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Test authentication and authorization
- Verify data encryption and PII protection
- Check for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Test rate limiting and abuse prevention

**Tools:**
- OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning
- Custom scripts for security testing
- Manual penetration testing
